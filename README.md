# Daily Planner (JavaScript)

I created this Daily Planner project to learn about web development, focusing on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project helps users manage tasks by allowing them to add, complete, and remove tasks easily.

The goal was to practice **DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS styling** while building a simple and useful tool.
